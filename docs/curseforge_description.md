## 🏠 Beginner's Delight - A Safe Start for New Adventurers

**Survive your first night with a ready-made starter base!**

Beginner's Delight automatically generates a small starter house at the world spawn point, giving new players a safe shelter with essential supplies to begin their Minecraft adventure.

## ✨ Features

### 🏡 Starter House at Spawn
- **Automatic Generation**: A small wooden house appears at the world spawn point when a new world is created
- **Survival Essentials**: Includes a bed, chest with starter items, and torch lighting
- **Multiple Designs**: Randomly selects from several house variants for variety
- **Terrain Adaptive**: Placement adjusts to the local terrain surface

### 📦 Starter Supplies
The chest in the starter house contains helpful items for early game:
- Food (bread, apples)
- Basic wooden tools
- Torches for lighting

### 🎮 Multiplayer Ready
- Works on both singleplayer and multiplayer servers
- All players spawn at the same location near the starter house
- The house is generated only once — no duplicates

### 🔧 Safe to Remove
- Built entirely with vanilla blocks (oak wood, cobblestone, etc.)
- The structure remains intact even after removing the mod
- No custom blocks or items that would cause issues

## 📖 How It Works

1. **Create a New World**: Start a new world with the mod installed
2. **Spawn Safely**: You'll spawn next to a small house with supplies
3. **Get Started**: Open the chest for starter items and sleep in the bed to set your spawn
4. **Adventure Awaits**: Head out to explore with a safe base to return to!
